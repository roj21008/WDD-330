    <h2>Further Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There is nothing stopping you from adding your own properties
             to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript</li>
        <li>IIFEs are a useful way to accomplish a task while keeping the wrapped variables within the scope of the function. 
            This means that the global namespace is not polluted with many variable names.</li>
        <li>Because the code is only executed once, there is no need to create any reusable 
            named functions, and all variables will also be temporary</li>
        <li>Note that much of this can be accomplished in ES6 simply by putting the code 
            inside a block. For example:</li>
            
        <dd>{<br></dd>
            <dd>   Console.log(“Hello”) <br></dd>
            <dd>} <br></dd>
            <dd><< Hello;</dd>
        
        <li>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code within its own private scope so that it does 
            not interfere with any other part of the program. Using IIFE in this way means that code 
            can be added or removed separately.</li>
        <li>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function can not only call itself, but also define and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.
            
        
        </li>
        <li>A recursive function is one that calls itself until a certain condition is met. It is a useful tool to use when dealing with iterative processes</li>
        <li>By using callbacks, we make sure that waiting for these tasks to complete does not delay the execution of other parts of the program. Once the task has completed, the callback will be invoked before returning to the rest of the program.</li>
        <li>When a promise is created, it calls an asynchronous operation and is then said to be pending. It remains in this state while the operation is taking place.
            
            <dd>a. At this stage, the promise is said to be unstable</dd>
            <dd>b. After the operation is complete, the promise is said to have been fulfilled.</dd><br>
        </li>
        <li>Pure functions help make functional programming code more concise and predictable than other programming styles. Referential transparency makes pure functions easy to test, since they can be trusted to return the same values when given the same arguments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>AJAX</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ajax is a <strong>technique</strong> that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading.  that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, 
            and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading. </li>
        <li>Today, it's unusual for Ajax not to be used when a partial web page update is required.
            The explosion in the use of public APIs also means that Ajax is used more than ever to transport data back and forth between sites.</li>
        <li>The fetch() method returns a promise that resolves to the response returned by the URL that was supplied as an argument.</li>
        <li>We can get more granular control over the request being made by providing a Request object as an
             argument. This allows you to set a number of options on the request.</li>

        <li>We can also use Ajax to send information. It can be a variety of formats, but is usually a JSON string.</li>
