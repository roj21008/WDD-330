    <h1 >Notes - Week 8</h1>
    <h2>Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS3 transform property allows you to translate, rotate, scale and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
        <li>We can manipulate the appearance of an element using transformation functions . The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they are supplied</li>
        <li>The <span> translation </span> functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.</li>
        <li>As with translate , you can also use the scaleX (x) or scaleY (y) functions . These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions, respectively.</li>
        <li>To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions.</li>
        <li>Browser support for the transform-origin property is the same as for the transform prefix, being necessary when the transform property requires it:</li>
        <li>Transitions allow CSS property values to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.</li>
        <li>Don't cite the name of the animation. <br> 
            Each keyframe looks like its own nested CSS declaration block</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it is a markup metalanguage. In plain language, it is a system for annotating text.</li>
        <li>Unlike the canvas, images created with SVG are available through the DOM.</li>
        <li>To view an SVG file, simply open it via the File menu in any browser that supports SVG</li>
        <li>Both canvas and SVG allow you to draw custom shapes, paths, and fonts.</li>        
    </ul>
