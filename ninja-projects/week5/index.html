    <h2>TESTING AND DEBUGGING</h2>
    <ol>
        <il> Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will apply strict mode
             to all JavaScript in the file. And if you're using someone else's code, there's no 
             guarantee that you've coded in strict mode. This technique will ensure that only 
             your code is forced to use strict mode.</il>
        <il>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to display a dialog at certain
             points in the code. Because alert() halts a program's execution until OK is clicked, it allows 
             us to effectively place breakpoints in code that allow us to check the value of variables at that 
             point to see if they are what they are. we hope they are.</il>
        <il>Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before submitting any code, otherwise the 
            program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!</il>
        <il>The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, which causes the execution 
            of the program to stop.</il>
        <il>Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any bugs will 
            be caught early on.
            </il>
        <li>A test can simply be a function that tests that a piece of code executes as it should.</li>
    </ol>
