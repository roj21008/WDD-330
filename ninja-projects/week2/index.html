    <h1>Notes - Week 2</h1>
    <h2>Programming Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Well-commented code is the hallmark of a ninja programmer</li>
        <li>It is considered good practice to write each statement on a new line, terminated with a semicolon</li>
        <li>Words reserved for use by the JavaScript language and cannot be used to name variables</li>
        <li>JavaScript has a special operator called typeof to find out the type of a value</li>
        <li>Using “const” is a useful way to deal with long strings or expressions, 
            as it saves us from having to type them over and over again.</li>
        <li>Why was the new word let introduced in ES6?<br> Why not just change the behavior of var?<br>
            Remember that a basic principle of the JavaScript language is that it must remain <br>
            backward compatible. This means that the behavior of var had to remain constant,
            so it couldn't simply be changed in ES6.<br>For that reason, let the new keyword was introduced.</li>
        <li>If the variable refers to a non-primitive data type, such as an array, function, 
            or object, using const will not make it immutable.</li>
        <li>Not using let and const makes a global variable.</li>
        <li>The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings</li>
        <li>The best approach is to try to be very explicit about the types of values you are working with. <br>
             If you need to change the type, do it manually, rather than relying on type coercion to do it for you</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> An array is an ordered list of values</li>
        <li> Arrays are not primitive values but a special built-in object</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A ninja programmer should always declare functions using function literals, function declarations, or function expressions.</li>
        <li>Don't Repeat Yourself, or DRY, is a programming principle that specifies that each part of a program should only be written once. This avoids duplication and means there is no need to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.</li>
        <li>All functions have a read-only property called name.
    </ul>
