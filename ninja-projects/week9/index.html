<h1>WEEK 9 NOTES</h1>

    <h1>WINDOW OBJECT</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>You must reference global variables without using the window object; it's less typing and your code will be more portable between environments.</li>
        <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that displays the message provided as an argument and gives the options of OK or Cancel. Returns boolean values ​​of true if the user clicks OK and false if the user clicks Cancel:
            or window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');</li>
        <li>It's worth noting that most browsers allow users to disable dialogs from appearing repeatedly, which means they are not a feature to rely on.</li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. Contains a number of properties that provide information about different portions of the URL.</li>
        <li> The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited page in the current browser session.</li>
        <li>he Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows you to do things like turn off the device's screen, detect a change in its orientation, or lock it in a specific orientation.</li>
        <li>A restriction of cookies is that they can only be read by a web page of the same domain that configured them. This is to prevent sites from being able to access information about users, such as other sites they have visited.</li>
       
    </ul>

<br><br>
<h1>API HTML 5</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The restriction of using only a string value can be overcome by encoding any JavaScript object or value as a JSON string and then performing a type conversion later as needed.</li>
    <li>Data attributes provide a convenient way to add data directly into HTML markup, allowing for a richer user experience.</li>
    <li>The fact that only strings can be saved may seem like a restriction at first, but by using JSON, we can store any JavaScript object in local storage</li>
    <li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user's device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>  <li></li>
</ul>
