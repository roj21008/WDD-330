    <h1>Notes - Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>we have to use index notation to return the first (and only) form object, like so:<br>
            const form = document.forms[0];</li>
        <li>Instead of using a numeric index, we can use the name attribute to identify a form:<br>
            const form = document.forms.search;
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Modern Javascript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks. JavaScript is an extremely flexible language that can accomplish most programming tasks 
             but not all undertakings are as easy to do as they should be</li>
        <li>However, by using the jQuery library, we can achieve the same result using a single line of code:</li>
        <li>A big advantage of utilizing a popular library is that it will be used by lots of people and thoroughly 
            tested. It will most likely have been optimized and battle-tested for nearly every eventuality. </li>
        <li>There are some disadvantages to using libraries, however. You need to include the code for the library
             as well as your own code. </li>
        <li>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time in server-side languages. It’s a common way of designing software, and used by server-side 
            frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django.</li>
